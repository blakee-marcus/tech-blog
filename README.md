<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. A simple Google search for any idea thousands of think pieces and tutorials from developers of all skill levels!  


My challenge this week was to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a WordPress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. I had to build this site entirely from scratch and deploy it to Heroku. This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
